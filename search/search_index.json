VIDEO : Kubetap introduction by Matt Hamilton Use Cases Security Testing When assessing web applications, it is common to use BurpSuite, MITMproxy, Zap, or other intercepting proxy to capture and modify HTTP requests on a security tester\u2019s machine. These requests are intercepted and modified on the tester\u2019s local machine prior to being sent to the remote server. While this paradigm allowed testers to capture and modify all traffic that the testers themselves create, testers can not see traffic destined for the target server that originates from other Services. The lack of visibility of intranet traffic that does not originate from a tester\u2019s machine can hamper a tester\u2019s ability to competently review complex systems and environments. For environments that use Kubernetes, Kubetap is altering the status quo. Kubetap allows testers to select a target Service and intercept all traffic that is destined for that Service, regardless of where the requests originate. The transparency and visibility afforded by Kubetap allows testers to better understand and exercise the Service without the prohibitively (expensive) time cost of configuring and deploying a proxy manually. Microservices deep in a technology stack that were once inaccessible to testers can now be proxied with ease. Developer debugging When an application or microservice is exhibiting unintended behavior, developers must debug the application through a debugger, printf statements, or static code analysis. This is often because infrastructure architecture looks something like this: What happens when the bug is only exhibited when deployed to staging and production, and not in a local development environment? [xkcd-979] xkcd While there are tools like Telepresence that allow developers to move containers running in a cluster on to their local machines for debugging, this is a heavy-handed approach and not practical in many situations.
